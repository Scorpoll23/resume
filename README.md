I'm a recent graduate of a master’s degree in advanced computer science at Northumbria University and I'm excited to pursue a career in software development. 
My academic background in advanced computer science has given me a strong foundation in all aspects of computer science. See my code at: https://github.com/Scorpoll23


EDUCATION

Master of Science (M.S.) - Advanced Computer Science	Sep 2021 - Nov 2022
Northumbria University, Newcastle
My master’s degree and undergraduate degree, both in computer science, have given me a comprehensive understanding of software development. 
I was taught UML to design and document code, coding patterns, databases/data lifecycle, refactoring, web development, big data, cloud computing, cybersecurity, 
networking, machine learning, microservices, solid design principles, Object oriented design, relational databases, object relational databases, and NoSQL databases.  

My thesis was on the topic of machine learning, specifically the design of a deep convolutional neural network to remove reverb and echo from recorded speech. 

My modules covered software development of all kinds, from high level to machine code and programming using logic gates. I worked on group projects using GitHub as source control. 
I have experience using Visual Studio, Unity, Unreal Engine 4, Oracle, MongoDB, Laravel, Jupyter, Microsoft Azure, Spark, TensorFlow, and many others. 

Most importantly I understand that computer science is always changing, and syntax is secondary. I'm confident in self-teaching any language I may be presented with, 
along with any frameworks needed. A firm foundation in sound engineering practices can be applied to any technology I'm faced with.  


Bachelor of Science (B.S.) – Computer Science w/ Games Development	 
Northumbria University, Newcastle                             Sep 2017 - Oct 2020

My first degree in computer science gave me all the basics of computer science, along with many languages mentioned in my master’s degree section. 
The main focus was on object-oriented software, with functional and procedural also being taught. 

As well as languages and frameworks, other science skills were taught. HCI gave a valuable insight in how the public interact with computers, 
and how this should inform the design of systems. There was also an emphasis on UX/UI design to ensure a smooth user experience. 

Technologies: 
Main languages: Java, SQL, C++, C#, Python, HTML, PHP, CSS, JavaScript

Main frameworks: .Net, Spring/Spring Boot, Laravel, ASP.NET

Well versed in Microservices architecture, MVC/MVP, Azure cloud services, and Containerisation with Docker/Kubernetes
